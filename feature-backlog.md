## Detailed Feature Descriptions

# Core Booking Features

## 1. Booking: Logged-in player books the court  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
As a logged-in player, I want to see existing bookings and be able to book a free time via a modal, with automatic overlap validation.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Player must be logged in to see booking page.  
2. Existing bookings for the selected day are listed in format:  
   `Mon 15 Aug 14:00–16:00 [PlayerName]`  
3. “Book court” button opens a booking modal.  
4. Modal allows selecting date, start time, end time.  
5. Overlap validation prevents booking if times conflict.  
6. Successfully submitting creates a Firestore booking and updates the list immediately.

---

## 2. Booking: Cancel my booking  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
As a logged-in player, I want to cancel my own bookings so others can use the court.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Only the player who booked the time sees a “Cancel” button.  
2. Cancel opens a confirmation modal.  
3. On confirm, the booking status becomes `"cancelled"` instead of deleting the document.  
4. Security rules ensure only the involved player can perform the cancellation.  
5. UI updates and booking is removed from the active list.

---

## 3. Public schedule (no login)  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
As a visitor, I want to see which times are booked without seeing who booked them.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Page is publicly accessible.  
2. Shows booked times but hides names.  
3. “Log in to book” button is visible to visitors.  

---

## 4. Highlight my own bookings  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
As a logged-in player, I want my own bookings to be clearly highlighted.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Own bookings appear with visual marker (badge, color, icon).  
2. Other players’ bookings appear normal.  
3. Works consistently across dates and reloads.

---

## 5. Quick suggested booking times + "Choose time" manual option  
**Status:** [Idea/Paused]

**Description**  
As a player, I want fast one-click booking suggestions, with the option to manually choose time.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. System shows a list of free suggested time slots.  
2. Clicking a suggestion books immediately (after validation).  
3. "Choose time" button reveals manual time entry fields.  
4. Manual entry uses the same overlap validation.  
5. Manual time entry uses autocomplete component with 15-minute increments and smart suggestions.  
6. Time input auto-fills with next 15-minute interval when date is selected.  
7. Suggestions respect player's preferred booking duration (if set).

---

## 6. Preferred booking duration in profile  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
As a player, I want to set my preferred booking duration (e.g. 60/90/120 minutes) so suggestions match my habits.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Profile page has a "Preferred booking length" dropdown.  
2. Stored as `preferredBookingLengthMinutes`.  
3. Used when generating suggested time slots.  
4. Pre-fills end time in manual booking form.  
5. Fallback default if not set.

---

## 29. Simplified Booking Flow (Move Modal Controls Inline)  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
Move the existing booking modal controls into an inline form on `HomeView`, keeping today’s time-input behaviors (desktop autocomplete, native mobile time inputs) and using Cally for date selection. No references to the modal should be needed once the controls are inline.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Inline form (no modal): date + time inputs and submit live directly on the booking page (same view as today), replacing the modal.  
2. Date input: Cally date picker opens when the field/icon is clicked; closes on selection/click-away; highlights chosen date; loads bookings for that date.  
3. Time inputs: reuse current behavior—desktop gets autocomplete suggestions; mobile uses native `type="time"`; validate start < end and valid times for the selected date.  
4. Unavailable times: after a date is selected, show booked intervals for that day beneath the time inputs; refresh when date or bookings change.  
5. Submit button: always enabled; on press validate date selected, start < end, and no overlap with booked intervals; show inline errors on failure; on success create booking (`userId`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `status="booked"`, `createdAt`) and refresh bookings/unavailable times.  
6. Form UX: layout order is date (Cally), start time, end time, unavailable times, submit; after success the date stays selected and time inputs can reset; bookings and unavailable times refresh.  
7. Home view parity: replace the current date/time booking UI in `HomeView.vue` with the inline form and remove modal-based booking references.

**Notes / Future Enhancements**
- Preferred booking duration could auto-fill end time after selecting start time.  
- Quick suggested slots could appear above the form, reusing date and duration logic.  
- Opponent selection can be added as an optional field once core flow is stable.

## 14. Edit existing bookings  
**Status:** [Planned]

**Description**  
As a logged-in player, I want to edit my existing bookings to change the time or date if needed.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Only the player who booked the time sees an "Edit" button.  
2. Edit opens a modal with current booking details pre-filled.  
3. Overlap validation prevents editing to times that conflict with other bookings (excludes current booking from overlap check).  
4. Only involved players can edit the booking.  
5. Security rules ensure only authorized players can perform edits.  
6. UI updates immediately after successful edit.

---

## 15. Opponent support in bookings
